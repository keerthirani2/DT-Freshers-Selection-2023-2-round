## Introduction

Welcome to the Productivity Analysis project! In this project, we analyze the productivity data of three team members (Neha, Amit, and Sachin) at DeepThought, a CultureTech startup, over a period of three weeks.

## Objective

The primary objective of this analysis is to understand the self-assessment, productivity, and growth potential of Neha, Amit, and Sachin within the company. We will identify their strengths, areas for improvement, and offer personalized feedback and recommendations.

## Data

The data for this analysis is obtained from the productivity assessments conducted during three consecutive weeks. The assessments include self-assessment scores and explanations for various parameters related to their efforts, technical skills, cross-functional skills, persona development, and efficiency improvement.

## Analysis

1. Data Compilation: We will combine the data from Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3 into a single dataset for analysis.

2. Calculate Average Scores: We will calculate the average scores for each parameter across all weeks for each team member.

3. Qualitative Analysis: We will perform a qualitative analysis of the explanations provided by Neha, Amit, and Sachin for their scale responses. This will help us understand their motivations and perspectives.

4. Comparative Analysis: We will compare the productivity data of Neha, Amit, and Sachin to identify similarities and differences in their self-assessments and growth potential.

5. Personalized Feedback: Based on the analysis, we will offer personalized feedback and recommendations to each team member to support their growth and contribution to the organization.

## Results

The analysis will provide insights into the self-assessment and productivity levels of Neha, Amit, and Sachin over the three weeks. We will identify strengths, areas for improvement, and growth potential for each team member.

## Visualization

The project will use data visualization techniques such as bar charts and comparative graphs to present the analysis results effectively.
