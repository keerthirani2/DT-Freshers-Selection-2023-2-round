## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the satisfaction of the CEO (Mr Octopus) with the individual progress of the Student Unicorns in the company. The analysis is based on weekly scorecards provided by the CEO, where the Student Unicorns are evaluated on various parameters such as contribution, initiative, and bottleneck analysis.

## Objective

The primary objective of this analysis is to assess how satisfied the CEO is with the individual progress of the Student Unicorns. We will analyze the weekly scorecards, calculate average scores, and identify any trends or improvements over time.

## Data

The data for this analysis is obtained from the weekly scorecards provided by the CEO. Each scorecard contains ratings for each Student Unicorn on the parameters of contribution, initiative, and bottleneck analysis. The data is organized into separate sheets for each week.

## Analysis

1. Data Cleaning: We will clean and combine the data from all weeks to create a single dataset for analysis.

2. Calculate Average Scores: We will calculate the average scores for each Student Unicorn across all weeks for each parameter.

3. Visualize Trends: We will use line charts to visualize the trends in individual progress scores over the weeks.

4. Comparison: We will compare the scores of each Student Unicorn to identify top performers and areas for improvement.

## Results

The analysis will provide insights into the CEO's satisfaction with the Student Unicorns' progress. We will gain a better understanding of how they are performing on different parameters and how their progress evolves.

## Visualization

The project will use various data visualization techniques such as line charts and bar charts to present the analysis results clearly and intuitively.

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, we will conclude the CEO's satisfaction with the individual progress of the Student Unicorns. We will also identify any patterns or improvements that can be made to support their growth.
