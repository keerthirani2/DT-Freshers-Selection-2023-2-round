## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the happiness scorecards of the Student Unicorns over a period of three weeks. The scorecards contain ratings for different parameters such as how happy they felt, their performance satisfaction, and enjoyment at work.

## Objective

The primary objective of this analysis is to understand the happiness and satisfaction levels of the Student Unicorns over time. We will compare the scores between different weeks and identify any trends or improvements.

## Data

The data for this analysis is obtained from the happiness scorecards provided by the Student Unicorns for three consecutive weeks. The scorecards contain ratings for various parameters related to their happiness and satisfaction.

## Analysis

1. Data Compilation: We will combine the data from Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3 into a single dataset for analysis.

2. Calculate Average Scores: We will calculate the average scores for each parameter across all weeks for each Student Unicorn.

3. Visualize Trends: We will use line charts and bar charts to visualize the changes in happiness scores over the three weeks.

4. Compare Weekly Scores: We will create side-by-side bar charts or box plots to compare the happiness scores for each parameter across the three weeks.

5. Qualitative Analysis: If available, we will perform sentiment analysis on any qualitative feedback to gain deeper insights into the Student Unicorns' feelings and experiences.

## Results

The analysis will provide insights into the happiness and satisfaction levels of the Student Unicorns over the three weeks. We will identify any trends, patterns, and areas where improvements can be made.

## Visualization

The project will use various data visualization techniques such as line charts, bar charts, and box plots to present the analysis results in an easy-to-understand manner.
